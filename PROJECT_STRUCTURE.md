# Project Structure & Best Practices

This app was generated by **polyfront-scaffold**. It uses a clean, extensible layout that works for React (Vite/Webpack) and Angular.

```
<project>/
  public/
  .env.development
  .env.test
  .env.production
  .env.example
  src/
    api/ assets/ components/ context/ features/ hooks/ i18n/
    layout/ pages/ routes/ services/ store/ styles/ tests/ utils/
```

See the repo README for folder-by-folder guidance.
